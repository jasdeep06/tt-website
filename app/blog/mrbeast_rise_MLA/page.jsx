                <p>In February 2023, YouTube unveiled a feature that, in its simplicity and effectiveness, dramatically boosted the viewership of top influencers like MrBeast. This game-changing tool? Multi-language audio tracks.</p>
                <br />

                <p className="font-bold text-3xl mb-10">Understanding Multi-Language Audio on YouTube</p>

                <p>This feature is a boon for global audiences, enabling them to enjoy videos with language-dubbed audio tracks. It essentially breaks down the language barrier, allowing viewers to enjoy content in their mother tongue directly on the creator's main channel, without the need to search for a separately dubbed version.</p>
                <br />

                {/* <video className="lg:w-1/2 w-full m-auto my-5" autoPlay loop muted>
                    <source src="/mla_demo.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
                </video> */}
                
                {/* <p>
                    Viewers also have the flexibility to switch audio tracks mid-video. By clicking on the Settings icon (the gear symbol), selecting 'Audio Tracks', and choosing their preferred language, they can change the dubbing as they wish.</p>
                <br />

                <p>


                    The impact of this feature is significant. For example, JakiDale and Jamy – Epicurieux, channels that utilized our services at TranslateTracks, saw a remarkable spike in viewership. </p>

                <p className="font-bold text-3xl my-8">The Advantage of Multi-Language Audio for YouTubers</p>
                <p>Consider the stats: a vast majority of the world doesn't speak English, yet many popular YouTubers, including MrBeast, primarily create content in English. For a content creator on YouTube, the ultimate aim is to continuously expand their viewership. Once you've saturated your local market, the next step is to go global. That's where multi-language audio tracks come into play.</p>
                <br />

                <p className="font-bold text-3xl my-8">MrBeast's Strategic Move</p>
                <br />

                <p>
                Originally, MrBeast tackled the language barrier by creating separate channels for different languages, like MrBeast Espanol. However, with the introduction of YouTube's multi-language audio, he was able to <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/multi-language-audio-mrbeast-interview/" _blank className="underline">add dubbed tracks to his original videos.</a> This not only streamlined his process but also centralized his audience, significantly boosting his views. In an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&si=vJNCXVQV4k1nPOFb&v=8bDRVP9xSfc&feature=youtu.be" className="underline">interview</a>, MrBeast credited this feature for substantially increasing his per-video viewership.</p>
                <br />
                <p>This isn't just about MrBeast. YouTube reports that creators using this feature saw around 15% of their watch time coming from viewers utilizing the dubbed audio tracks.</p>

                <p className="font-bold text-3xl my-8">Activating Multi-Language Audio as a Viewer and Creator</p>
                
                <p>For viewers, it's as simple as clicking the Settings icon on a video and selecting their preferred audio track. </p>

                <video className="lg:w-1/2 w-full m-auto my-5" autoPlay loop muted>
                    <source src="/mla_demo.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
                </video>

                <p>For creators, they can easily add multiple audio tracks in various languages using the Subtitles Editor while uploading their content.</p>
